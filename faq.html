                                    A resume, sometimes called a CV or curriculum vitae, is a document
                                    mostly used to showcase your career background, skills, and
                                    accomplishments when searching for a job. Resume Build helps you
                                    create professional resumes tailored to the specific industry or
                                    job you want in just minutes.

                                    Resumes should grab the recruiter’s attention in just a few
                                    seconds, and Resume Build helps you create the perfect resume
                                    using expert tips and pre-written resume examples to build it fast
                                    and easily. While the length of the resume depends on the career
                                    field and experience of the applicant, a two-page resume is ideal,
                                    according to employers.

                                    Resumes should be between one to three pages long depending on
                                    your experience and career goals. Our guide on resume length will
                                    help you determine how many pages make sense for your specific
                                    situation.

                                    We recommend including a “Key Skills'' section on your resume that

                                    bulleted list. Our guide to hard skills vs. soft skills will help
                                    you decide which items should be included on your list.
